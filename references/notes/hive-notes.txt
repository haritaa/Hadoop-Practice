Hive
	- What is Hive?
		- Data Analysis/Warehousing Tool
		- Structured Data
		- Schema on Read
		- Provides SQL like interface (HiveQL) to do analysis
		- Declarative
		
	- Pig vs Hive
	
	- Hive vs RDBMS
	
	- Hive Architecture
		- CLI (Hive Shell / Beeline) | Web UI - Hue
		- Metastore -> Embedded, Local or Remote - RDBMS (Derby, MySQL, Oracle)
		- Driver
		- Compiler -> Parsing, Code Generation, Compiling, Optimization, Execution Plan
		- Execution Runtime -> Query (MR job) Execution and Status Tracking
		
	- Hive Datamodel
		- Schema/Database  - Namespace
		- Table
			- Rows
			- Columns
			
	- Data Types    
		- Primitive - tinyint,smallint,int,bigint,float,double,string,boolean,date,time,timestamp,decimal(10,4)
		- Complex	- struct, map, array, union
	
	- DDL
		- Create Schema/Table/View/Index
		- Alter Schema/Table/View/Index
		- Drop Schema/Table/View/Index
		
	- Table Types
		- Managed Table		=> Lifecyle managed by Hive
		- External Table	=> Metadata managed by Hive and Table content managed by users/developers
		- Partitioned Table		=> Data be partitioned based on given set of fields and more efficient while querying
		- Clustered/Bucketed Table => Data be distributed into different buckets based on hashing and more efficient while sampling and joins
		- Temporary Table 	=> Limited to current session
		
	- File Types - SERDES
		- CSV/TSV
		- JSON
		- TXT
		- XML
		- LOGS
	
	- File Formats
		- TEXT
		- AVRO	=> row based, stores data in binary format, compression, maintains schema, suitable for write heavy workloads
		- RC
		- ORC	=> column based, binary format, high compression, compatible with Hive, suitable for read heavy workloads
		- Parquet => column based, binary format, efficient compression, suitable for read heavy workloads
		- Sequence	=> binary, compressed, combining lot of smaller files into big file		
		
	- DML
		- INSERT
		- SELECT
			- WHERE
			- GROUP BY
			- HAVING
			- ORDER BY | SORT BY
			- JOIN
			- LIMIT
			
	- LOAD DATA 'filepath' INTO 'table'
	- INSERT DIRECTORY 'filepath' AS 'query'			
			
	- Views
		- Normal Views
		- Materialized Views
			
	- Builtin Functions
		
	- UDF (User Defined Function)
	- UDAF (User Defined Aggregate Function)		
	- UDTF (User Defined Table Generating Functions)
